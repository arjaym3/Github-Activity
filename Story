One day, three friends were walking along the lakeshore path when one of them spotted a crocodile blocking the trail. On of the friends, Bob,
thought that it was strange to see a crocodile in Wisconsin, and noted this in his mind. Suddenly, a strange man wearing a cloak walked out of the trees, and picked
up the crocodile with only his index finger. They then saw another man walk up behind them, holding a platypus on his index finger.
