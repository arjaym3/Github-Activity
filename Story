One day, three friends were walking along the lakeshore path when one of them spotted a crocodile blocking the trail. On of the friends, Bob,
thought that it was strange to see a crocodile in Wisconsin, and noted this in his mind. Suddenly, a strange man wearing a cloak walked out of the trees, and picked
up the crocodile with only his index finger. They then saw another man walk up behind them, holding a platypus on his index finger. 

It was here the group of friends realized that their index fingers would never be strong enough to lift either a platypus or a crocodile. This led Bob to have one
of the best ideas that anyone in their group had ever had, gym memberships. Soon the group of friends were members at Anytime Fitness in Madison and decided that 
they were going to become to the strongest group in town.

Now in the gym some of the other frequents there thought they were a little odd. After every workout they would do curls with just their index finger trying to one day be like 
the strange figures they ran into on lakeshore path. Although the friends were all becoming impressively strong, their main goal was to have the same finger strength as those shady 
figures. They still to this day have competitions with eachother to see who can lift the most with just their index finger.
